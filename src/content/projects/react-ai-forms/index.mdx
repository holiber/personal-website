# React AI Forms

Back in the ChatGPT-3 days, before tools like Cursor existed, I had to build my own code editor with an integrated chat that could generate React components in a consistent style.

I put it together using various open-source tools: Workbench (as the editor), RocketChat (for the chat engine), ReactCosmos (for UI), StackBlitz (for cloud-based coding), and a slightly customized version of n8n to handle the bot's training.

At first, I trained it to generate React forms with validation. It all ran in the browser and supported cloud saving.
