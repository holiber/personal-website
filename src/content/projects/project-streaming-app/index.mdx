I started thinking about what a truly user-friendly video streaming app should look like — something even astronauts could use to film a moon landing.
OBS just doesn’t cut it; I can’t imagine trying to use it, especially with gloves on.
That’s what inspired me to design a new interface with big, intuitive controls that are easy to use in any situation.
