  I worked on an online document editor integrated into Mail.Ru Cloud, allowing users to create and edit documents right in their browser.
  Mail.ru had around 17 million daily active users and 49 million monthly users. Besides editing, the core of this project also powered the generation of millions of high-quality document previews inside usersâ€™ mailboxes.
