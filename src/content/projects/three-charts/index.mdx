# Three Charts
Back when I needed to render interactive financial charts, I couldn’t find any library truly optimized for it. Everything I tried was either laggy or drained my laptop battery super fast. So I ended up building my own solution that used the GPU as much as possible.

If I had to do the same thing today, I’d just go with https://lightningchart.com/
