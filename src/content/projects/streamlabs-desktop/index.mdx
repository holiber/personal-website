  I worked at Streamlabs (part of Logitech) as a Principal Software Engineer, where I helped build tools for streamers.
  
  One of the most exciting projects I worked on was Streamlabs Desktop (formerly Streamlabs OBS). Itâ€™s an open-source app that helps streamers go live on popular platforms, interact with their audience, design their stream layout, and grow their channels.
  I was deeply involved in shaping it from day one, providing the core features and architecture.
  The app is built with Electron, React, and Ant Design.
