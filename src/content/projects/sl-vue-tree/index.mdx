Back when Vue 2 was just released, there was a real lack of quality UI components.
I needed something to display and work with hierarchical data, but couldn’t find a good fit — so I built my own. That’s how this small but highly customizable library was born. It helped me a lot, and turned out to be useful for other developers too. It now has over 300 stars on GitHub.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for tree nodes
- **Customizable Styling**: Flexible theming and styling options
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support for better development experience
- **Vue.js Integration**: Seamless integration with Vue.js applications
- **Extensive Configuration**: Multiple configuration options for different use cases

## Technical Details

Built with modern Vue.js practices and TypeScript for type safety. The component provides a robust foundation for building complex tree structures in Vue applications.
