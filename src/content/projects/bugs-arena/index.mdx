# Bugs Arena

Back when WebSockets first became available in browsers, I was eager to try them out. I started wondering: is it possible to build a truly interactive online game, with lots of moving objects on screen, all perfectly synced between browsers?

Thatâ€™s how Bugsarena was born â€” a simple multiplayer game built with plain (vanilla) JavaScript. I also wrote a short article about the development process: https://habr.com/ru/articles/225669/

Note: the core code was written **over 10 years ago**, so it probably doesnâ€™t follow modern JS best practices. But hey, it still works ðŸ˜„
