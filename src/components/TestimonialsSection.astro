    quote: "I had the pleasure of working with Alex on one of the recent projects. He’s a strong, experienced engineer who takes full ownership—able to lead and grow complex initiatives from idea to delivery independently. Alex combines deep technical expertise with creative, non-obvious problem-solving; his communication is excellent—clear, proactive, and empathetic—making collaboration smooth with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. On top of that, he’s simply great to talk to about work and life. I’d gladly work with Alex again and recommend him without hesitation.",
